## Assignment 1: Bruises — The Data We Don’t See
This project is a collaboration between [Giorgia Lupi](https://giorgialupi.com/) and the musician [Kaki King](https://www.kakiking.com/)

### Bruises and how the collaboration started
This project started when the musician Kaki King realized that her daughter, Cooper had [Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) Condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_thrombocytopenic_purpura), a type of thrombocytopenic [purpura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura) defined as an isolated low platelet count with a normal bone marrow in the absence of other causes of low platelets. ITP is an auto-immune disease that causes a characteristic red or purple bruise-like rash and an increased tendency to bleed.

King started data collection based on Cooper's symptoms as a way to relieve her anxiety and to be able to keep control on a situation that was out of her control. ***I began to write down what I was seeing on Cooper’s skin, what activities we did that day, what treatments she had and what her reading were, as well as how I was feeling. My fear, stress, my hope. My thoughts and feelings.”*** Data was collected during 4 month and then systematized by Lupi.

In Lupi's words: ***Through my work, I thought, I could try to help her process and communicate her emotions: the feelings anyone of us experience when coping with our own illness or that of a beloved one.*** She asks on her [Medium Post](https://medium.com/@giorgialupi/bruises-the-data-we-dont-see-1fdec00d0036): Can looking at a data visualization make you feel part of a story of a human’s life?

The gathered data constituted a historical record –similar to a music score– that represented the bruises progression in Cooper's body and a visual representation of that progression, that represented in space the characterization described by Kaki. Lupi's goal was to ***evoke empathy and activate us also at an emotional level, and not only at a cognitive one.***

### Methodology: Data Humanism

The principle Lupi employed in this process is what she calls Data Humanism, a way of design that ***include empathy, imperfection and human qualities in how we collect, process, analyze and display (...)*** data, as she estates at her last [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/giorgia_lupi_how_we_can_find_ourselves_in_data/).

The artist –in order to create a narrative with the data gathered– had to dive into the data in order to find underlying structures or time patterns that could explain Kaki's sensations, anxiety and the progress of the disease on Cooper's body. In order to do that, Lupi structured the information based on it's smaller structure: each day was represented with a white petals. Then, days were grouped by the periodicity in which platelets counts were performed, so each platelet count represented by a bunch of red dots was followed by a bunch of white petals.

On top of this structure other elements of King's collection were displayed: bruises intensity, petechiae on Cooper's skin, medications, if Kaki was or not at home, positive moments, and Kaki's level of fear and hope. Using all this elements Lupi built the final visualization of Cooper and Kaki's process which was musicalized by Kaki herself and animated by [Andrea Bax Bassan](http://www.andreabax.com/). Here can be seen the [audiovisual piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvxVWukROTw).
