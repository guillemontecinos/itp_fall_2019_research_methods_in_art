## Assignment 1: Bruises — The Data We Don’t See, by [Giorgia Lupi](https://giorgialupi.com/)

* Collaboration between Giorgia Lupi and [Kaki King](https://www.kakiking.com/)
* Kaki's daughter, Cooper has [Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) Condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_thrombocytopenic_purpura), which is a type of thrombocytopenic [purpura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura) defined as an isolated low platelet count with a normal bone marrow in the absence of other causes of low platelets. It is an auto-immune disease that causes a characteristic red or purple bruise-like rash and an increased tendency to bleed.
* ***Through my work, I thought, I could try to help her process and communicate her emotions: the feelings anyone of us experience when coping with our own illness or that of a beloved one.***
* ***ITP is a very visual disease,***
* The project started with Kaki collecting data based on Cooper's sympthoms: ***I began to write down what I was seeing on Cooper’s skin, what activities we did that day, what treatments she had and what her reading were, as well as how I was feeling. My fear, stress, my hope. My thoughts and feelings.”***
* Then data was systematized by Giorgia
