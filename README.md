## Assignment 1: Bruises — The Data We Don’t See
* Collaboration between [Giorgia Lupi](https://giorgialupi.com/) and [Kaki King](https://www.kakiking.com/)

### Bruises and how the collaboration started
* Kaki's daughter, Cooper has [Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) Condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_thrombocytopenic_purpura), which is a type of thrombocytopenic [purpura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura) defined as an isolated low platelet count with a normal bone marrow in the absence of other causes of low platelets. It is an auto-immune disease that causes a characteristic red or purple bruise-like rash and an increased tendency to bleed.
* In Lupi's words: ***Through my work, I thought, I could try to help her process and communicate her emotions: the feelings anyone of us experience when coping with our own illness or that of a beloved one.***
* ***ITP is a very visual disease,***
* The project started with Kaki collecting data based on Cooper's sympthoms: ***I began to write down what I was seeing on Cooper’s skin, what activities we did that day, what treatments she had and what her reading were, as well as how I was feeling. My fear, stress, my hope. My thoughts and feelings.”*** Data was collected during 4 month and then systematized by Lupi.

* The gathered data was converted into a piece composed in music score that represented the bruises progression in Cooper's body and a visual representation of that progression, that represented in space the characterization described by Kaki. Lupi's goal was to ***evoke empathy and activate us also at an emotional level, and not only at a cognitive one.***

> Can looking at a data visualization make you feel part of a story of a human’s life?
