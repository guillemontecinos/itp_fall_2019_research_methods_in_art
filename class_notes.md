## Class 8 – Avant-Garde as Method: Vkhutemas, Bauhaus an the Invention of Modernism
*Anna Bokov*

* Transformation in education that happened during the 2nd industrial rev (~1940)
* There where two referents: Bauhaus & Vkhutemas
* Bauhaus (means building house):
    * Series of publications
    * "International Architecture" that became "modern architecture" and also "international architcture" (the last coined by MOMA)
    * [MOMA Cubism and abstract art](http://1vze7o2h8a2b2tyahl3i0t68.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Cubism-and-Abstract034.jpg)
* **Vkhutemas: Higher art and thecnical studios**
    * Institutional school
    * Alfred Barr jr., MOMA
        * Visited USSR and Vkhutemas to learn about their art
        * He put Bauhaus & Vkhutemas together in an exhibit (?)
    * There where publications about Vkhutemas in France (at least), so it was well known at the time
    * Both schools where started after socialists revolutions in Russia (1918) and Germany (1917)
    * "The last futurist exhibition of paintings", 1915 -> artistic expression anticipated world shifting
    * "The black square", 1915 by Malevich, one of the most radical paintings
    * Artists not representing the world around them, but taking the agency to represent their own reality with very political stand
    * Nietzsche (1944 - 1900) as referent
    * After the 1st international the idea is the entire world was gonna change
    * USSR wanted to erradicate illiteracy
    * **The school Institutionalized the avant-garde**
    * democratization of art
    * Bauhaus manifesto (1919) was inspired by the creation of the russian school
    * Free state art studios were created in 1919 after dissolving classic academies (Svomas). That included women as artists and not only as models
    * School is set as an institutional condensator of the social changes 
    * That is the moment when schools attempted to create new architecture and art that don't replicates classic art -> schools are institutions where societies can colletively create and think
    * All movements had to be represented in the school curriculum
    * Kandinsky was very important in the creation of the Soviet school
        * Interested in time-based art and pinting and sculture
        * He was synesthetic
        * Idea of unitary school
        * He is kicked out by a younger generation of artists going to Germany
        * Then he joins Bauhaus
    * 1927 their reformed Vkutemas into Vkutein, that was closed in 1930
* **Vkutemas <> Bauhaus**
    * 1924-25: Vkhutemas: 1445 students / Bauhaus: 127 students
    * Vkhutemas had a more functional focus than Bauhaus that pursued a more aesthetic and experiential purpose. Example of the tea pots
    * It's important to remark that those new designs were built with old era's tools
    * Architecture was part of the vukhtemas from the begining, but it was included in Bauhaus later
        * There were classes of space
* **Teaching as experiment**
    * New pedagogy was about constructing 
    * New paradigm was: Drawing what we see was transformed into drawing what we imagine
    * They started thinking of light as a material 
    * Josef Albers
    * This is the moment when basic shapes become part of the artistic production, as squres or circles
* **Grafika**
    * [Alexandr Rodchenko](https://www.moma.org/artists/4975)
    * [Varvara Stepanova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varvara_Stepanova)
    * 
* Was vkhutemas more massive because of the socialist regime?
* What happened in fascist regimes at the time?
* how both projects, but specially vukhtemas influenced post war soviet monumental architecture and other non-soviet but affiliated expressions as yugoslavian architectura and urbanism?
